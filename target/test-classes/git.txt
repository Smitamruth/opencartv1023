Git(local repo) =====> Github(remote repo).

Activities by Devops Team:  using process called PROCESS AUTOMATION.
Build creation
Run Automation
Build Certification

Build is created by taking code form Dev team repository. 
Then automation is run by taking the code from Testing team repository. 
Next day the build will be certified by DEVOPS team.
That build will be downloaded in QA envt and further tests are carried out. 

Maven: Compile code || Run code || Test code || Package || Install.
Jenkins: Runs Automation.

Whatever the dev team will do, same thing is done by QA team. But the difference is development team will develop the code for our app.
The testing team will develop test scripts for automation purposes.
Initial 2 or 3 builds we will not ave stable build. Hence no automation is done.
After 2/3 builds, we start automating scripts and the TCs are pulled into remote repo. These are executed by devops on the same night.
Thus most of the times, sanity tetsing is done during the night itself.
Basic functionality will be tested in the devops itself.

The build is created using Maven and automation is run using Jenkins.
