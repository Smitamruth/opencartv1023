Grid - is a tool that works mainly on 2 components - 1) Hub 2) Nodes.
	 - Grid is used to run the automated programs in remote environment.
	 
Client ====> Hub ====> Nodes.

Hub is setup in the client machine itself. Its where the test cases are written and executed & where the entire setup is being controlled.
Node is a remote machine - Different OS like Windows, Mac, Linux. And in every OS, different browsers are installed.

Nodes are attached to Grid and Hub recognizes & controls all the nodes.
While running the tests from hub, we specify which OS and which browser we want to run. 
Thereby Hub uses this info and directs the test case to that machine/node.

Ex: If you're running on a main host(WINDOWS machine). In this, you can install a VMware software and you can open the LINUX/MAC/UNIX. 
	Thereby, we are maintaining many VMs.

Setting up multiple VMs is as costly as getting different physical machines.

Before Docker came into use, we used VMs. 
VMs were installed and in those VMs, different browsers were installed ==> make them as nodes. This is difficult to maintain.

To overcome the difficulty of using different VMs, we started using DOCKER.  
Docker - automatically download the DOCKER image(machines will be available in the form of images) from the DOCKER REMOTE REPOs. 
From that image, we create a container. Container, though not a VM, works as VM.
We can download multiple images and create multiple containers in each image. Each container acts as a NODE.

By default, the DOCKER contains GRID. Doesn't directly provide the nodes. We have to download images and create container which will act as nodes.

Single system can act as HUB & NODE ==> such system is called as STANDALONE system.
HUB with multiple NODES attached to it ==> called as DISTRIUTED system.

2 types of setup possible:
1) Standalone -- one system acts both as hub and node.
2) Hub and Node setup -- multiple systems involved.
