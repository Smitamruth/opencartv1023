Git(local repo) =====> Github(remote repo).

Activities by Devops Team:  using process called PROCESS AUTOMATION.
Build creation
Run Automation
Build Certification

Build is created by taking code form Dev team repository. 
Then automation is run by taking the code from Testing team repository. 
Next day the build will be certified by DEVOPS team.
That build will be downloaded in QA envt and further tests are carried out. 

Maven: Compile code || Run code || Test code || Package || Install.
Jenkins: Runs Automation.

Whatever the dev team will do, same thing is done by QA team. But the difference is development team will develop the code for our app.
The testing team will develop test scripts for automation purposes.
Initial 2 or 3 builds we will not ave stable build. Hence no automation is done.
After 2/3 builds, we start automating scripts and the TCs are pulled into remote repo. These are executed by devops on the same night.
Thus most of the times, sanity tetsing is done during the night itself.
Basic functionality will be tested in the devops itself.

The build is created using Maven and automation is run using Jenkins.

Git and GitHub workflow:

Working Directory ====> Staging Area ====> Git Repository.
Untracked file (add)====> Tracked File (commit)====> Committed File (push)====> Remote File.

1) Create a new local repository by using git init. (one time)
2) Provide user info to the git repo. (one time)
	git config --global user.name "your name"
	git config --global user.email "your email"
	git status - shows untracked files(still in local).
	
3) Adding files/folders to staging/indexing.
	git add -A
	git add filename
	git add *.java
	git add foldername
	
4) Commit te changes to Local repo.
	git commit -m "commit message"
	
5) Form a connection between remote and local.
	
	Go to git hub and create a new repository and copy the link generated.
	Ex:	https://github.com/Smitamruth/opencartv1023.git
	
	git remote add origin "https://github.com/Smitamruth/opencartv1023.git"  		==> connects local repo to remote repo.

6) Push the code into remote repo.
	git push origin master
	
	Go to github ==> settings ==> developers settings ==> personal access token classic
